No action is taken if the hotkey is already Off. Toggle: The hotkey is set to the opposite state (enabled or disabled).

On: Enables the hotkey if it is currently disabled. Off: Disables the hotkey if it is currently enabled. This is typically used to create a hotkey in an initially-disabled state. B or B0: Specify the letter B to buffer the hotkey as described in #MaxThreadsBuffer. Specify B0 (B with the number 0) to disable this type of buffering. Pn: Specify the letter P followed by the hotkey's thread priority. If the P option is omitted when creating a hotkey, 0 will be used.
